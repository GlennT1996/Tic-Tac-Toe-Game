Introduction
Welcome to my Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game! As someone just starting out with web development, I'm excited to share this project with you. It's a basic implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game we all know and love, designed to be played in any modern web browser. This game is the result of my journey into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

Features
Simple and intuitive UI: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players can click to mark their X or O.
Reset functionality: A reset button allows you to clear the board and start a new game anytime.
Win detection: The game automatically detects a win or tie and alerts the players of the outcome.
Responsive design: Thanks to Bootstrap, the game is responsive and should look good on devices of various sizes.

How to Play
Start the game: Open the index.html file in your web browser to start the game.
Make your move: Click on any empty square to make your move. The game starts with player X and then alternates to player O.
Win or tie: The game announces a win or tie through an alert message. Wins are detected across rows, columns, or diagonals.
Reset if needed: Click the "Reset Game" button at any time to start over.

Setup
No special setup is required! Just download the files and open index.html in your browser.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the game's layout.
CSS: Styles the game board and controls. Includes responsive design adjustments via Bootstrap.
JavaScript: Powers the game's logic, such as player turns, win detection, and the reset feature.

What I Learned
This project was a great opportunity for me to apply the basics of web development. Here are a few key takeaways:

DOM Manipulation: I learned how to interact with the DOM using JavaScript, such as getting elements by their ID and responding to user events like clicks.
Game Logic Implementation: Implementing the logic for win detection and player turns was a fun challenge that improved my problem-solving skills.
Responsive Design: Using Bootstrap, I gained a better understanding of making web pages that adjust to different screen sizes.
