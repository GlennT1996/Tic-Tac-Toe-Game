Introduction:

A Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game! As someone just starting out with web development, I'm excited to share this project with you. It's a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played in any modern web browser. This game is the result of my journey into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:

UI: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players can click to mark their X or O.
Reset button: A reset button allows you to clear the board and start a new game.
Win detection: The game automatically detects a win or tie and alerts the players of the outcome.
Responsive design: The game is responsive and should look good on devices of various sizes because of Bootstrap 5.

How to Play:

Start the game: Open the index.html file in your web browser to start the game.
Moves: Click on any empty square to make your move. The game starts with player X and then switches to player O.
Win or tie: The game alerts to a win or tie through an alert message. Wins are detected across rows, columns, or diagonals.
Reset: Click the "Reset Game" button at any time to start over.

Setup:

Just download the files and open index.html in your browser.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structures the game's layout.
CSS: Styles the game board and controls.
JavaScript: The game's logic, such as player turns, win detection, and the reset feature.

What I Learned:

This project was a great opportunity for me to apply the basics of web development. 

Takeaways:

DOM Manipulation: I learned how to interact with the DOM using JavaScript, such as getting elements by their ID and responding to user events like clicks.

Game Logic Implementation: 

Implementing the logic for win detection and player turns was a fun challenge that improved my problem-solving skills.
Responsive Design: Using Bootstrap, I gained a better understanding of making web pages that adjust to different screen sizes.
